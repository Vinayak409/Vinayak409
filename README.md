I am a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about problem-solving, algorithmic challenges, database engineering, and building scalable applications. Currently, I am working at [Wisflux Tech Labs](https://www.wisflux.com/), where I contribute to a comprehensive full-stack project using React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.

In addition to full-stack development, I am deeply interested in database engineering and have hands-on experience with PostgreSQL, which has further fueled my passion for efficient data handling and optimization. Before joining Wisflux, I completed an internship at [Bit to Byte Robotics](https://bbr.org.in/), where I honed my frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

Outside of my professional work, I’ve taken on various web development projects that have strengthened my proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and cloud-native technologies like Docker, Redis, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions. I’m also continuously expanding my knowledge of Java to enhance my backend expertise.

I enjoy sharing my learnings, collaborating with teams, and tackling complex technical challenges. If you're looking for a developer with a solid foundation in full-stack development and a passion for database management, let's connect and explore impactful solutions together!
